# ProtoQuill 2.13->3->2.13 Sandwich Pattern

Example using ProtoQuill with upstream and downstream 2.13 dependencies.
Following the sandwich pattern as defined here: https://scala-lang.org/blog/2021/04/08/scala-3-in-sbt.html
ProtoQuill is used in the Scala 3 `middle` module and query results
are used in the `main` project.
